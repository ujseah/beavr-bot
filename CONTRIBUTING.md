# Contributing to ü¶´ BeaVR

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **BeaVR**! We value all contributions, code is not the only way to help. Answering questions, improving documentation, reporting bugs, or simply spreading the word are all immensely valuable to the community.

If BeaVR helped you, consider ‚≠êÔ∏è starring the repo, referencing it in your projects/blogs, or sharing your experience.

Please also be mindful to respect our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute to BeaVR in many ways:

- Fixing bugs or improving existing modules.
- Implementing new robot adapters or extending simulation support.
- Adding new VR input devices (Quest, Vision Pro, LEAP Motion, etc.).
- Contributing to documentation and tutorials.
- Submitting feature requests and reporting issues.

We encourage you to coordinate with the community on our [Discussions](https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot/discussions) or by opening an issue.

## Submitting Issues or Feature Requests

### Found a Bug?
Please:
- Ensure it hasn‚Äôt already been reported (search under *Issues*).
- Provide:
  - OS type and version.
  - Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions.
  - A **minimal code snippet** (ideally runnable in <30s).
  - Full error traceback.
  - Screenshots or logs if relevant.

### Requesting a Feature?
A good feature request includes:
1. **Motivation**  
   - Is it solving a limitation or frustration in BeaVR?  
   - Is it something you need for a project? Tell us!  
   - Is it something you prototyped and think could benefit others? Even better.
2. A short description (one paragraph).
3. (Optional) Example code showing how the feature would be used.
4. Links to related papers, projects, or prior art.
5. Any extra context (sketches, diagrams, etc.).

## Adding New Robots, Policies, or Environments

BeaVR is designed to be modular.  
When adding new capabilities, follow the existing API patterns:

- **Robots (URDF + adapters):**
  - Add your robot driver and interface in `beavr/teleop/robots/`.
  - Update `available_robots` and configuration entries.
- **Simulation environments (MuJoCo, Isaac Gym, etc.):**
  - Add the new env wrapper under `beavr/sim/`.
  - Update config defaults in `configs/`.
- **Policies (learning-based control):**
  - Add your class under `beavr/policies/`.
  - Register it in `available_policies`.
  - Add tests under `tests/test_policies.py`.

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone & Fork

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-handle>/beavr-bot.git
cd beavr-bot
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot.git
```

### 2. Create a branch

Always work in a feature branch, never on `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git checkout -b feature-my-contribution
```

### 3. Install Development Environment

Conda:

```bash
conda create -y -n beavr-dev python=3.10
conda activate beavr-dev
pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

Poetry:
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash 
pre-commit install
```

Run Tests:

```bash
pytest
```

### 5. Run Teleop Locally

Example usage from (`main.py` configs):

```bash
python -m beavr.teleop.main --robot_name=leap --laterality=right
python -m beavr.teleop.main --robot_name=xarm7 --config_file=config/dev.yaml
```

---

## Style and Standards

- Code must pass ruff linting/formatting
- Use pre-commit run -all-files before pushing
- Write clear commit messages ([guide](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/))

---

Pull Requests

Before submittingL
1. Ensure your branch is rebased on `upstream/main`.
2. verify all tests pass
3. Add or update documentation
4. Add tests for new functionality

Submit via GitHub PR. It's normal for maintainers to request changes.

---

## Checklist Before PR

- Clearn, descriptive PR title
- Link to related issue(s)
- Mark as draft if WIP
- All tests pass locally

---

Tests

- Install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) if you haven't:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

- Run:

```bash
python -m pytest -sv ./tests
```

Thank you üéâ

Every contribution makes BeaVR stronger and more accessible. Whether you fixed a typo, added a driver for a new robot, or extended simulation support, you‚Äôre helping the robotics community.
